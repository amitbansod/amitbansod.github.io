I have been fortunate to travel in more than 15 countries around the world and this blog is the reflection of those experiences.

I believe travelling is one of the best ways to explore the world and yourself. It is a journey everyone should take and concur. I hope this blog will help fellow travellers, motivate people to travel more and enjoy the journey!

Some inspirational quotes I like:

"To travel is to take a journey into yourself."" - Danny Kaye

"Not all those who wander are lost." - J.R.R. Tolkien

"Only by going alone in silence, without baggage, can one truly get into the heart of the wilderness." - John Muir

"A good traveler has no fixed plans, and is not intent on arriving." - Lao Tzu

"Half the fun of the travel is the esthetic of lostness." - Ray Bradbury

"A traveler without observation is a bird without wings." - Moslih Eddin Saadi

"Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail." - Ralph Waldo Emerson

Life is what you make it !
