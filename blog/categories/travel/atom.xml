    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started my first solo visit to South America from Santiago, Chile. I chose to travel predominatnly in Chile for few reasons: Considering geography of Chile, it has some of the unique places from southern Patagonia, Central Valley to Atacama Desert in north; I had slightly less than 4 weeks for this trip; and it was also cheaper to plan my itinerary from Santiago ;-) .</p>

<p>I planned to stay in Santiago for few days before heading south towards Central Valley. The plan was to head north of Chile from Central Valley towards San Pedro de Atacama and to keep going further north to Peru, all the way to the last stop, Lima before heading home. I booked an open jaw flight for this trip which allowed me to fly to Santiago and fly back from Lima. Such tickets are very convenient than round trip tickets and in my case it was way cheaper as well! My itinerary was Madrid to Santiago (onward) &amp; Lima to Madrid (return).</p>

<p>After 13 hours of flight from Madrid, I arrived at the Santiago airport in the morning. The immigration &amp; custom process were seamless. You should take care not bring any fresh fruits &amp; vegetables to Chile as it is not allowed. Once outside, I took the Centro Puerto bus to goto Santiago. This bus service is cheap ($ 1600 pesos) and very convenient unless you have heavy/bulky luggage.</p>

<p>I stayed in hostel in the Brazilian neighbourhood, an area between metro stations &ldquo;Republica&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;Cummins&rdquo;. Being one of the oldest neighbourhood in Santiago, you get a real picture of the city in this area. It has some nice, old restaurants where you can sit, chat with locals and get to know more about them. The houses &amp; surrounding graffitis have a distinct look!</p>

<p>On the next day, I decided to take a walk in local areas of Santiago. To get acquinted with the local areas, I deciced to first take a guided tour to get some information beforehand. The tour4tips company organizes a local tour of west side of Santiago. This part is bustling with local markets, old town and people. The places where people of Santiago shop, eat and celebrate.</p>

<p>The walk started from the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes. The Museum, one of the oldest museums in South America, is known for collection of fine arts centered around Chile and South America. A good place to visit if you are interested !</p>

<p>I walked towards the west neighbourhood near the Calicanto bridge over Mopocho river. This bridge was planned by then Spanish corregidor Zañartu and it became a major architectural monument before it was demolished in 1888. Some of the old shops in the area still uses his name.</p>

<p>The first stop was Mercado Central, though called a fish market from old times, it is now designed on concept of shop-and-dine where shops and restaurants are lined up side-by-side. The outer part of market has more shops and few restaurants. You will find extensive seafood here. As you go inside, you find more restaurants beside each other.</p>

<p>The restaurants are on expensive side but should be worth it as the raw food is supposed to be fresh from the market! I tried a dish called Pastel de Jaiba (crab pie infused with cheese). It was excellent! The price was around 8000 $. Other typical dish to try is Caldillo de congrio (Conger eel soup).</p>

<p><img src="/images/9.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p>

<p>The next stop was &ldquo;La Vega&rdquo; or the vegetable market. The market was quite full with lively faces on a Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>The vegetable market has a special significance with people working here. The sign “Después de Dios está la Vega” at the market describes the significance of this place. Pablo Neruda, Nobel Laurate from Chile, was inspired by the people working here and dedicated one of his poems to them.</p>

<p>People from all walks of life come here to celebrate the existence of this wonderful place.</p>

<p>More information here (in spanish).</p>

<p><img src="/images/14.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p>

<p>In the end, we tried Sopaipillas, a local delicacy you will find everywhere in Chile served with hot salsa sauce. I got chance to chit-chat with the Chef &amp; Co. The down to earth nature and welcoming faces makes you feel home!</p>

<p>They thought I am from Italy for unknown reasons. :D</p>

<h2>Practical Information</h2>

<p>Santiago has excellent metro where you can buy point to point tickets for 640/700 $ (non-peak/peak) with unlimited transfers. To use buses. You need a bip card which makes sense if you planning to stay for more than a week.</p>

<p>Santiago offers lot of things to do depending on your taste. In a nutshell, hike to the hill Cerro Santa Lucia for a great view of the city, visit the Museo Chileno de Arte Precolombino to know about history of this place through generations, take a walk around Plaza de Armas area in the afternoon and spend the evening at pubs/clubs in Bellavista area.</p>
